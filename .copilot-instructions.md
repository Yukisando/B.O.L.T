# Copilot Instructions for BOLT

## General Guidelines

### Testing
- **Never generate tests** - This project does not use automated testing frameworks
- Do not suggest or create test files, test functions, or testing-related code

### Code Maintenance
- **Clean up legacy code** when adding new features
- Remove outdated functions, variables, or comments that are no longer needed
- Refactor old patterns to match current implementation standards
- Delete unused imports, variables, or helper functions

### Comments Policy
- **Add comments sparingly** - only for lines that are unclear or very complex
- Avoid obvious comments that simply restate what the code does
- Focus comments on explaining:
  - Complex WoW API interactions
  - Non-obvious business logic
  - Workarounds for WoW client limitations
  - Performance optimizations

### Project Context
- This is a World of Warcraft addon written in Lua
- Uses WoW API and addon development patterns
- Follows standard WoW addon structure with `.toc` file and modular organization
- Focus on performance and minimal memory footprint typical for WoW addons

### Code Style
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Prefer readability over clever one-liners
